# RethinkDB-CMS



**Phase 2:** Providing a bare-bones admin for a generic JSON datastore.  
**Phase 1:** A livefeed of any changes to that datastore for consumption by client apps.

RethinkDB-CMS uses [RethinkDB](https://www.rethinkdb.com/) and [socket.io](http://socket.io/). 

## Phase 1

Admin of the RethinkDB is to be done via another mechanism, and this version of rethinkdb-cms offers a live socket feed everytime something updates.

#### I am using [chateau](https://github.com/neumino/chateau) as the CMS

Here is a sample usage of configuring a rethinkdb-cms live feed:

```
to do ...
```

And here is the code for a sample client app to consume that:

```
also to do ...
```



## Phase 2

Develop the CMS ... this part of the project I do not see myself getting to in the short term ... I would love to but need to focus on feed-my-family work.

If you would love to donate to this project, I would love that, and it would mean I am able to do this Phase 2 part, which is the namesake of this npm module.
